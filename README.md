## Key Architecture

The project is built using **React** with a component-based architecture. We opted for **React** due to its efficient DOM rendering and scalability for building interactive user interfaces.

- **State Management**: We use **Redux ToolKit** to manage the global state for the cart. This allows us to maintain consistent state across components.
  
- **Styling**: We use **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI** for styling to ensure consistency in the UI and to speed up development. Its responsive design features help maintain a uniform look across devices.

- **Data Fetching**: We use **RTK Query** for efficient data fetching and caching. It simplifies the process of making API requests, automatically managing loading states, caching responses, and handling errors.

- **Type Safety**: We use **Typescript** accrossed the project to maintain strong type safety and API interection.
